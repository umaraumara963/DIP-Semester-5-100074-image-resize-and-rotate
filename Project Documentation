2. Student Information

Name: umara iqbal

Course / Subject: Digital Image Processing

3. Project Overview

This project demonstrates basic image processing operations, specifically image rotation and image resizing.

Image Rotation: Turning an image by a specified angle.

Image Resizing: Changing the dimensions of an image without affecting its content significantly.


These operations are widely used in:

Computer vision

Digital image editing

Preprocessing for machine learning

Medical imaging



---

4. Objectives

1. Learn how to rotate an image by a given angle.


2. Learn how to resize an image to desired dimensions.


3. Understand basic image manipulation techniques in digital image processing.


4. Apply Python or MATLAB functions for image processing tasks.

5. Tools & Software Used

Python programming language

Libraries:

OpenCV (cv2) for image processing

NumPy for array manipulation

Optional: Matplotlib for image display


IDE: Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm / Spyder

6. Methodology

Step 1: Read Image

Load the image from storage using OpenCV:


import cv2
image = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')

Step 2: Resize Image

Resize the image by width, height, or scaling factor:


resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (new_width, new_height))

Step 3: Rotate Image

Rotate image by a specific angle:


(h, w) = image.shape[:2]
center = (w//2, h//2)
matrix = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(center, angle, 1.0)
rotated_image = cv2.warpAffine(image, matrix, (w, h))

Step 4: Display Output

Show the original and processed images:


cv2.imshow("Original Image", image)
cv2.imshow("Resized Image", resized_image)
cv2.imshow("Rotated Image", rotated_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Step 5: Save Output

Save processed images to storage:


cv2.imwrite('resized_image.jpg', resized_image)
cv2.imwrite('rotated_image.jpg', rotated_image)

9. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how digital images can be manipulated using basic operations like resizing and rotation.

It provides understanding of image matrix operations, coordinate transformations, and image display/save techniques.

Useful for preprocessing images in real-world applications such as computer vision and machine learning.
