# **Image Rotation and Resize**

## **Project Overview**

This project is part of the **Digital Image Processing** course. The main objective is to implement **image rotation** and **image resizing** techniques using digital image processing concepts. These operations are fundamental in image analysis, computer vision, and multimedia applications.

---

## **Objectives**

* **Understand basic image transformation techniques**
* **Implement image rotation at different angles**
* **Perform image resizing (scaling up and down)**
* **Preserve image quality during transformations**

---

## **Description**

The **Image Rotation and Resize** project focuses on transforming digital images by changing their orientation and dimensions.

* **Image Rotation** allows an image to be rotated by a specified angle (clockwise or counterclockwise).
* **Image Resizing** changes the width and height of an image while maintaining aspect ratio when required.

These operations are widely used in image preprocessing, pattern recognition, and graphical applications.

## **Features**

* **Rotate images by custom angles**
* **Resize images to desired dimensions**
* **Supports common image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)**
* **Simple and efficient implementation**
